The Transportation Flexible Spending Account (TFSA) ecosystem, is an EVM-compatible DApp and token that facilitates a universal metro card network that allows users to transfer remaining balance from one metro to another.
  
- The TFSA DApp is built on the Rootstock ecosystem core contracts include the metro aggregator smart contract and the TFSA token contract. Additional token contracts are added based on the metro network issuing their ERC20 token.

- Garret Berg, Carlo Burgos, Annajune Ghrist, and Karim Hassan consultants from Accenture

- Testing for integrations included were...

- Building on Rootstock....

# Questions and Concerns Include:
- What if people can just pay directly without buying metro-specific fare, e.g. in NYC metro can just use credit card directly?
  - Not all metros have this, we're designing this for all metros
  - Employer subsidy case - employer isnt just going to give you cash
- How does the volatility in price of ETH, BTC, other tokens that can be exchanged for TFSA impact the monetary value of TFSA? Will employers have to pay more to stock their employees commute accounts if BTC is up?
  - The TFSA has its own ecosystem meaning the price of the TFSA token will be dependent on the supply and demand of users using the ecosystem. Employers can also directly work with the issuer in which they wouldn't have to pay more and still pay a fixed price.
- Is this only a use case for the metro system?
  - No, this can be expanded upon just the metro network, it can include bus, bicycle, other transportation forms, and other FSA types
- Why would the transportation companies or governments approve this system change?
  - Users can still pay in fiat if they want to however this optimizes different metro systems across the country while also giving transportation companies an opportunity for another stream of revenue which is from LP rewards and potentially transaction fees onchain
- How would you make users and companies adopt your system?
  - Users and companies would adopt the system just like any other DeFi protocol or DApp that has a value use case, the opportunity of generating another stream of income while allowing users to utilize the full amount of funds on their metro cards provides a solution that can be built upon further.
