The Transportation Flexible Spending Account (TFSA) ecosystem, is an EVM-compatible DApp and token that facilitates a universal metro card network that allows users to transfer remaining balance from one metro to another.
  
- The TFSA DApp is built on the Rootstock ecosystem core contracts include the metro aggregator smart contract and the TFSA token contract. Additional token contracts are added based on the metro network issuing their ERC20 token.

- Garret Berg, Carlo Burgos, Annajune Ghrist, and Karim Hassan consultants from Accenture

- Testing for integrations included were...

- Building on Rootstock....

Questions and Concerns Include:
- What if people can just pay directly without buying metro-specific fare, e.g. in NYC metro can just use credit card directly?
 - Not all metros have this, we're designing this for all metros
 - Employer subsidy case - employer isnt just going to give you cash
How does the volatility in price of ETH, BTC, other tokens that can be exchanged for TFSA impact the monetary value of TFSA? Will employers have to pay more to stock their employees commute accounts if BTC is up?
